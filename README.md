# Stochastic Methods and Simulation

## Description
This project consists of practical assignments (TP) exploring:
1. **Markov Chains**  
2. **Random Walks and Simulation**  
3. **Monte Carlo Methods**  

It is designed to help understand core stochastic processes and simulation methods using Python with Jupyter Notebooks.
